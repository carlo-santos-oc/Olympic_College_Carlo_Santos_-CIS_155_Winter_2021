                            COVID-19 comes from the Corona family of viruses. This category of viruses are common among
                            animals such as camels and
                            bats, but they have been able to infect humans as well. The name Coronavirus refers to the
                            crown-like spikes on the
                            surface of the virus. These spikes allow the virus to embed itself into our cells to take
                            over
                            them and reproduce.
                            Before COVID-19 we have faced other Coronavirus outbreaks in recent history. In 2003 SARS,
                            also
                            known as SARS-COV, first
                            appears in southern China. In 2012 MERS(MERS-COV) appeared in Saudi Arabia and reached
                            surrounding countries as far as
                            South Korea. COVID-19 is also known as SARS-COV2 and shares characteristics from both SARS
                            and
                            MERS.

                        <p>
                            What we typically refer to as Coronavirus today is COVID-19. It was
                            first detected in 2019 in
                            Wuhan China. This strain
                            is a previously unseen type in humans. Because it has never been
                            seen in humans before we have
                            little to no immunity.
                            COVID-19 also has a Basic Reproduction Number of 2.5. This means one
                            person could potentially
                            infect 2000 people. The
                            symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild to severe and mostly impacts
                            people of advanced age or with
                            previous health issues.
                            While a lot of people may survive with only experiencing mild
                            symptoms, other more vulnerable
                            people ultimately succumb
                            to pneumonia or other complications stemming from the infection.
