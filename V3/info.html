                        <p>
                            COVID-19 comes from the Corona family of viruses. This category of viruses are common among
                            animals such as camels and
                            bats, but they have been able to infect humans as well. The name Coronavirus refers to the
                            crown-like spikes on the
                            surface of the virus. These spikes allow the virus to embed itself into our cells to take
                            over
                            them and reproduce.
                            Before COVID-19 we have faced other Coronavirus outbreaks in recent history. In 2003 SARS,
                            also
                            known as SARS-COV, first
                            appears in southern China. In 2012 MERS(MERS-COV) appeared in Saudi Arabia and reached
                            surrounding countries as far as
                            South Korea. COVID-19 is also known as SARS-COV2 and shares characteristics from both SARS
                            and
                            MERS.

                            What we typically refer to as Coronavirus today is COVID-19. It was
                            first detected in 2019 in
                            Wuhan China. This strain
                            is a previously unseen type in humans. Because it has never been
                            seen in humans before we have
                            little to no immunity.
                            COVID-19 also has a Basic Reproduction Number of 2.5. This means one
                            person could potentially
                            infect 2000 people. The
                            symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild to severe and mostly impacts
                            people of advanced age or with
                            previous health issues.
                            While a lot of people may survive with only experiencing mild
                            symptoms, other more vulnerable
                            people ultimately succumb
                            to pneumonia or other complications stemming from the infection.

                        <h2 class="sub-header">Pandemic</h2>
                        <p>
                            Pandemic refers to a disease that has spread to a large area. It could be over several
                            countries or continents. In the case of COVID-19 it has spread worldwide. Before COVID-19
                            the last pandemic to affect such a large number of people was H1N1, also known as Swine Flu.
                            Swine Flu spread across the world in 2009 and claimed an estimated 284,000 lives. By
                            comparison COVID-19 has claimed an estimated 475,000 lives in the United States alone.

                        <h2 class="sub-header">Social distancing</h2>
                        <p>
                            Also called physical distancing, this is the practice of avoiding close contact with other
                            individuals in order to
                            reduce the risk of further spreading disease. Social distancing alone has had a significant
                            impact on our daily lives.
                            In the beginning stages of the pandemic businesses have been forced to either shut down or
                            operate at a severely reduced
                            capacity. The economy has suffered enormously but social distancing is a necessary practice
                            to keep our health care
                            systems from being overloaded. If too many people get sick at the same time we will max out
                            our hospital staff and
                            greater loss of life will occur.
